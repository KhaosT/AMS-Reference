AMS-Reference
=============
An interesting service in iOS 8

The protocol information is subject to change in later betas. Current protocol has been tested with iOS 8.0.2

*The OS X Demo doesn't work under OS X Yosemite since Core Bluetooth filtered AMS's CBService.*

The official documentation for AMS can be find at [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleMediaService_Reference/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014716-CH2-SW1).
